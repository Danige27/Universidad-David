      <p>I don't really have a competition, because the majority only includes 4 sports, but I pretend to cover more than 10 sports. <br>Eventhough, I would say that
      my main "enemies" are ESPN, Nike, and basically all webs that inform about sports 
    <br> They can get exclusive interviews, whereas they cannot give their opinion because they have influence on many people, <br>for which they cannot argue many of the opinions. I'll just say my opinion to attract and keep people on the web.</p>
